Hi everyone, my name is Pablo Rocamora García and in this video

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.990
I come to show the website that my partner Mario Amorós and I have developed.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.590
the page is called your medical encyclopedia dot es and in it we have created content

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.830
related to the field of health. On the home page we have added a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.410
form at the top right for quick searches

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.390
Next, we can find the table of contents of the home page.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.750
all the windows of the web have it and it is very important because it improves considerably

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.030
navigation. If we continue down we can see several methods to search for diseases such as

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.250
the search for disease by initials the visual search for parts of the body or the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.610
advanced search. Let's press for example the letter a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.010
to search for diseases with this letter and we will consult the stroke article or

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.720
ictus

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.180
here we have as I have already commented the table of contents of the article and the content

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.960
of the article itself

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.580
If we continue browsing the web.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.160
We can see other articles and also for example a contact form in case you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.150
feel like contacting us

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.780
Or the map of the website from which you can access certain pages directly

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,130
Directly to certain pages of the site.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.960
Finally, it should be noted that we have incorporated various display modes such as dark mode,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.040
accessible mode or high contrast mode to improve the accessibility of the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.500
Web

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.040
I will show below the dark mode to check the difference with the mode

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.720
default display here we can see that the page is darkened

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.750
and well, this would be the video, we hope you liked it, thank you very much for

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.190
get here

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.190
And see you soon.
